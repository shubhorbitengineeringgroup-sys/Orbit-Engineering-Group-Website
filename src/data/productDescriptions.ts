  "Bulk Flow Meter": "The bulk flow meter is precision made positive displacement liquid measuring instruments which maintain accurate metering over long periods of operation. The simplicity of design and construction together with the sustained accuracy of an Avery Hardoll bulk meter has led to the widespread use of these meters on aviation refueling vehicles in oil terminals throughout the world and also as master meters for use in calibration.

  "Ultrasonic flow meter": "An ultrasonic flow meter is a type of flow meter that measures the velocity of a fluid with ultrasound to calculate volume flow. Using ultrasonic transducers the flow meter can measure the average velocity along the path of an emitted beam of ultrasound by averaging the difference in measured transit time between the pulses of ultrasound propagating into and against the direction of the flow or by measuring the frequency shift from the Doppler effect. Ultrasonic flow meters are affected by the acoustic properties of the fluid and can be impacted by temperature density viscosity and suspended particulates depending on the exact flow meter.",
  
  "Water Meter": "Water metering is the practice of measuring water use.
